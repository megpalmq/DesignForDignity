        <ol>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Research & Discovery:</strong> We began by researching the
            risks and challenges seniors face in staying hydrated. This included
            understanding how age affects hydration levels and the most
            effective ways to encourage water intake for older adults.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Concept Development:</strong>With insights from our
            research, we identified key tips and strategies to include in the
            brochure. We aimed to provide clear, actionable advice to help
            seniors make hydration a priority, such as incorporating hydrating
            foods and setting regular water-drinking schedules.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Prototype Testing:</strong> The brochures were designed with
            large fonts, high-contrast colors, and simple visuals to ensure
            readability for older adults. Icons representing hydration and
            wellness were used to enhance clarity and visual appeal.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Final Solution:</strong> The brochures were finalized with a
            clean layout and engaging graphics to encourage seniors to make
            hydration a regular part of their health routine. We also ensured it
            was visually appealing while maintaining accessibility for the
            elderly.
