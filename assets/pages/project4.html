        As seniors age, managing chronic conditions like diabetes, arthritis,
        and digestive issues becomes essential. A balanced diet can ease
        symptoms and improve health. For diabetes, focus on meals low in refined
        sugars and high in fiber. For arthritis, include omega-3 fatty acids
        from fatty fish and flaxseeds to reduce inflammation. For acid reflux,
        opt for gentle, low-acid foods like oatmeal and bananas, and for
        constipation, include fiber-rich foods like whole grains, fruits, and
        vegetables. This brochure offers meal suggestions tailored to these
        needs, promoting healthier aging.

        <ol>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Research & Discovery:</strong> We started by researching the
            most common chronic conditions among seniors and how diet impacts
            their health. This helped us understand the essential nutritional
            needs and restrictions for individuals dealing with diabetes,
            arthritis, acid reflux, and constipation.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Concept Development:</strong> After gathering insights, we
            curated meal suggestions that fit the dietary requirements for each
            condition. We aimed for easy-to-prepare, nutrient-dense meals that
            promote health and are accessible for seniors.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Prototype Testing:</strong> The brochure uses a clean and
            organized layout to ensure clarity and ease of reading for older
            adults. We focused on large, legible fonts, high-contrast colors,
            and intuitive icons to guide the reader. Illustrations of healthy
            foods and seniors enjoying meals were included to make the brochure
            more engaging.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Final Solution:</strong> Understanding that seniors may face
            difficulty with cooking or meal preparation, we included simple
            recipes and meal prep
