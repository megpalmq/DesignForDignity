        This project focuses on creating two infographic posters that highlight the impact of diet on blood pressure and cardiovascular health, with an emphasis on the dietary needs of seniors. The first poster outlines the importance of a heart-healthy diet, including low-sodium foods and the benefits of the DASH Diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) for managing hypertension. The second poster features foods to avoid, such as processed snacks high in sodium, and offers healthy alternatives, including nutrient-rich herbs and whole foods. The goal of these posters is to educate seniors on how diet can effectively manage blood pressure and improve overall heart health.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Research & Discovery:</strong>The design process for this project began with thorough research on hypertension and the role diet plays in managing blood pressure, particularly for seniors. We focused on presenting complex health information in a simple, visually engaging way. The first step was to identify key concepts like the DASH Diet, low-sodium foods, and the types of foods to avoid.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Concept Development:</strong> With the research in hand, and our audiences in mind, we decided to make to opposing infographic posters. For the Korean Poster, we were inspired by old Korean style medicine and recipe books. To keep that feel we implemented some of the same style techniques to create a unique and visually appealing poster. For the Indy poster, we wanted to create a more modern and technically driven poster. We used bold colors and clean lines to create a visually appealing poster that would grab the audiences attention.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Prototype Testing:</strong> For the prototypes, we found it a bit difficult to get the right balance between the two opposing posters. We had to make sure that the posters were visually appealing and easy to read. We also had to make sure that the information was clear and concise.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Final Solution:</strong> The final posters were created using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign. We used a combination of bold colors, clean lines, and simple graphics to create visually appealing posters that effectively communicate the importance of diet in managing blood pressure.

          This project was a collaborative effort between Herron School of Art + Design and Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. Together, we researched food insecurity in both cities and developed solutions to address the challenges faced by vulnerable populations. By leveraging our shared expertise, we created a design that was culturally relevant and adaptable to the needs of both communities.
        </p>
        <p class="scroll-animate">
          Throughout this collaboration, our teams engaged in constant communication, exchanging ideas and feedback to ensure the project was culturally sensitive and impactful. Yonsei University provided valuable insights into the local needs of their community, allowing us to tailor the design to the unique challenges faced by residents in both Songdo and Seoul. This exchange of knowledge helped us develop a more comprehensive solution that bridges the gap between two very different but equally important communities.
