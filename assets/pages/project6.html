        This project focuses on the synergy between exercise and nutrition,
        emphasizing the importance of regular physical activity for elderly
        individuals. It highlights how exercise, when paired with a proper diet,
        can help maintain muscle mass, improve energy levels, and enhance
        overall mobility. The posters provide simple, accessible exercises that
        seniors can do at home or outdoors, catering to various fitness levels.
        Additionally, we include suggestions for post-exercise recovery meals,
        offering nutrient-dense options that support muscle recovery, joint
        health, and strength-building, ensuring seniors remain active and
        healthy as they age.

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Research & Discovery:</strong> Our team started by
            researching the best practices for elderly fitness and the role of
            nutrition in post-exercise recovery. We focused on exercises that
            are easy on the joints, while also promoting muscle strength and
            flexibility. In parallel, we examined the nutritional needs of
            seniors, identifying foods rich in protein, healthy fats, and
            essential vitamins and minerals to support muscle recovery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Concept Development:</strong>With insights from our
            research, we conceptualized a series of informative and visually
            appealing posters. The key focus was on creating an educational yet
            engaging design. We selected simple exercises such as chair squats,
            arm raises, and gentle stretching movements, ensuring they could be
            easily performed by seniors with varying mobility levels. We also
            paired these exercises with recovery meal suggestions like
            smoothies, lean meats, and anti-inflammatory foods.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prototype Testing:</strong> The design was tested for
            readability and clarity, especially considering the needs of older
            adults. Large fonts, high-contrast colors, and easy-to-understand
            icons were incorporated to ensure the posters were both visually
            appealing and accessible. We also included step-by-step visuals for
            exercises, ensuring that the instructions were clear and easy to
            follow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Final Solution:</strong> The final posters were polished
            with a clean layout, bold colors, and engaging images of seniors
            performing exercises. Each poster featured a clear section for
            exercise instructions and another for post-exercise meal
            suggestions. The goal was to create a resource that seniors could
            refer to regularly, empowering them to stay active and nourish their
            bodies for optimal health and strength. Let me know if youâ€™d
