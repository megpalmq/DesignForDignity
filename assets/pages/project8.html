        This project focuses on exploring the intersection of food insecurity
        and mental health among the elderly population. With the aging
        demographic growing worldwide, many seniors face not only physical
        challenges but also emotional and psychological burdens. One significant
        issue is food insecurity, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies,
        exacerbating existing mental health conditions such as depression,
        anxiety, and cognitive decline. Through this project, we aim to shed
        light on the daily struggles elderly individuals face in securing enough
        nutritious food, and how these challenges influence their mental and
        emotional well-being. Our goal is to provide practical insights,
        interventions, and raise awareness about how addressing food insecurity
        can significantly improve the quality of life for seniors. By combining
        education with advocacy, this project seeks to engage the community in
        finding sustainable solutions.

        <h3 class="scroll-animate">Design Process</h3>
        <ol>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Research & Discovery:</strong> Our design process began by
            understanding the needs of the elderly population in relation to
            food insecurity and its mental health implications. We conducted
            extensive research, gathering insights from elderly care
            specialists, nutritionists, and mental health experts
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Concept Development:</strong>Based on our findings, we
            conceptualized a design that would educate, inspire, and encourage
            action. We decided to focus on creating an informative yet visually
            appealing website that could be easily accessed by seniors and
            caregivers.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Prototype Testing:</strong> We created mockups and
            prototypes that would represent the challenges seniors face in a
            sensitive and relatable way. For the color palette, we chose
            calming, nature-inspired tones to evoke feelings of comfort and
            trust. The layout was designed to be clean and easy to navigate,
            ensuring accessibility for users with varying levels of
            technological literacy.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Final Solution:</strong> After multiple iterations, we
            implemented features such as infographics, resource links, and
            emotional well-being tips for seniors. The content was designed to
            provide clear, actionable steps, such as how to access food programs
            or manage stress related to food insecurity. We included
            testimonials and stories from real seniors to create a connection
            with the audience.
