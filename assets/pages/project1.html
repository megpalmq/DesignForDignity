        This collaborative project was aimed at addressing food insecurity and
        sustainability. We worked with local communities in
        Indianapolis to develop a design that would encourage sustainable food
        practices while ensuring that vulnerable populations had access to
        healthy meals.

        <ol>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Research & Discovery:</strong> We spent weeks gathering data
            from local food banks and community centers, interviewing residents
            and analyzing food insecurity in both cities.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Concept Development:</strong> After gathering insights, we
            brainstormed several solutions and created early prototypes using
            user-centered design principles.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Prototype Testing:</strong> We tested our solutions with
            real users, gathered feedback, and refined our designs to meet the
            needs of the communities.
          </li>
          <li class="scroll-animate">
            <strong>Final Solution:</strong> The final design focused on
            creating a food distribution platform with an easy-to-use interface
            and accessibility features for elderly residents.

          This project was a collaborative effort between Herron School of Art + Design and Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. Together, we researched food insecurity in both cities and developed solutions to address the challenges faced by vulnerable populations. By leveraging our shared expertise, we created a design that was culturally relevant and adaptable to the needs of both communities.
        </p>
        <p class="scroll-animate">
          Throughout this collaboration, our teams engaged in constant communication, exchanging ideas and feedback to ensure the project was culturally sensitive and impactful. Yonsei University provided valuable insights into the local needs of their community, allowing us to tailor the design to the unique challenges faced by residents in both Songdo and Seoul. This exchange of knowledge helped us develop a more comprehensive solution that bridges the gap between two very different but equally important communities.
