    to exacerbate the issue. <span>Design for Dignity</span> aims to shed light
    on these challenges through thoughtful design, raising awareness and

      Designers play a crucial role in addressing complex challenges like food
      insecurity through socio-cultural reimagining and collaboration with
      stakeholders. This study shifts from a deficiency-based approach, focusing
      on creative ways to communicate the link between food access and mental
      well-being. It explores design solutions to improve communication about
      food security for the elderly in Indianapolis.

      A key part of the project involved a pedagogical approach within the
      Visual Communication Design curriculum, developed through a virtual
      exchange with students from South Korea. The results will be shared in a
      poster that highlights community engagement, design research methods, and
      frameworks for evaluating the impact on the community.
