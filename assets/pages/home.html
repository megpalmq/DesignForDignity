    <h3>DESIGN WITH CARE. DESIGN FOR CARE. DESIGN TO CARE.</h3>
    <h3 class="ani">
      Food insecurity is a growing global crisis, affecting millions of people
      who struggle to access nutritious and sufficient food. From urban food
      deserts to rural hunger, economic disparities, climate change, and
      conflict continue to exacerbate the issue.
      <span>Design for Dignity</span> aims to shed light on these challenges
      through thoughtful design, raising awareness and fostering solutions that
      promote food accessibility, sustainability, and dignity for all.

        Designers play a crucial role in addressing complex challenges like food
        insecurity through socio-cultural reimagining and collaboration with
        stakeholders. This study shifts from a deficiency-based approach,
        focusing on creative ways to communicate the link between food access
        and mental well-being. It explores design solutions to improve
        communication about food security for the elderly in Indianapolis.

        A key part of the project involved a pedagogical approach within the
        Visual Communication Design curriculum, developed through a virtual
        exchange with students from South Korea. The results will be shared in a
        poster that highlights community engagement, design research methods,
        and frameworks for evaluating the impact on the community.
