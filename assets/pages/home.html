      A design study in Indianapolis focused on the unique challenges faced by older adults, such as dietary needs, food deserts, mobility and accessibility issues, and the impact of social services on their mental and social well-being. The research aims to identify effective changes in food systems and support structures to improve the overall quality of life for older adults facing these difficulties.

      A key part of the project involved a pedagogical approach within the Visual Communication Design curriculum, developed through a virtual exchange with students from South Korea. The results will be shared in a poster that highlights community engagement, design research methods, and frameworks for evaluating the impact on the community.
