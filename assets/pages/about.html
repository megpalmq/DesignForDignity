          Food insecurity is a pressing issue affecting many residents of
          Indiana, particularly in rural and urban areas. Despite the state's
          agricultural wealth, a significant number of Hoosiers face challenges
          in accessing nutritious, affordable food.
          <br /><br />
          This issue is often exacerbated by high poverty rates, unemployment,
          and a lack of access to food retailers in certain regions, resulting
          in food deserts. The elderly population is especially vulnerable, with
          many facing difficulties in obtaining fresh produce, largely due to
          limited mobility and fixed incomes. In cities like Indianapolis, Fort
          Wayne, and Evansville, low-income households struggle to meet basic
          nutritional needs, leading to poor health outcomes and increased
          reliance on food pantries and community food banks.<br /><br />

          Furthermore, food insecurity in Indiana has a significant ripple
          effect, impacting children's education, physical and mental
          development, and contributing to the cycle of poverty.
