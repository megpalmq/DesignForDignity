          Food insecurity is a pressing issue affecting many residents of
          Indiana, particularly in rural and urban areas. Despite the state's
          agricultural wealth, a significant number of Hoosiers face challenges
          in accessing nutritious, affordable food.
          <br /><br />
          This issue is often exacerbated by high poverty rates, unemployment,
          and a lack of access to food retailers in certain regions, resulting
          in food deserts. The elderly population is especially vulnerable, with
          many facing difficulties in obtaining fresh produce, largely due to
          limited mobility and fixed incomes. In cities like Indianapolis, Fort
          Wayne, and Evansville, low-income households struggle to meet basic
          nutritional needs, leading to poor health outcomes and increased
          reliance on food pantries and community food banks.<br /><br />

          Furthermore, food insecurity in Indiana has a significant ripple
          effect, impacting children's education, physical and mental
          development, and contributing to the cycle of poverty.

    The Boner Center for Civic Engagement in Indianapolis plays a vital
    role in combating food insecurity in the local community. Through its
    initiatives, the center helps provide access to healthy and nutritious
    food for residents facing challenges, especially in underserved areas
    and food deserts. The center collaborates with local food banks,
    nonprofits, and community organizations to address the root causes of
    food insecurity, focusing on long-term solutions that empower
    individuals and families.

    The center also provides educational programs and volunteer
    opportunities that engage students and community members in efforts to
    support food access and nutrition. By fostering collaboration and
    community-driven solutions, the Bonner Center is helping to reduce food
    insecurity and improve the quality of life for many Indianapolis

      <h2 class="section-title scroll-animate ">About the Collaboration</h2>
      <div class="text-content scroll-animate">
        <p>
          Yonsei University and Herron School of Art + Design students united to
          create impactful designs addressing food scarcity and health
          challenges for elderly communities in Korea and Indianapolis. Each
          team was assigned a distinct topic and presentation style, using
          visuals, typography, and layout to communicate the message
          effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          This collaboration was a valuable opportunity for students to learn
          from one another, explore diverse design techniques, and gain hands-on
          experience in addressing critical social issues through creative
          storytelling.
